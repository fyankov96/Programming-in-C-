// We first import some useful libraries
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// This is to avoid having to write std:: in many places (e.g. std::cout)
using namespace std;

// And here is the main entry point of our program
int main()
{
    
    // We simply send the string "Hello World!\n" to the console output
    cout << "Hello World!\n";
    
    // We finally return 0 to signal that everything went well
    return 0;
